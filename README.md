## User Stories
```
As a User,
so I can pick up the moods of London,
I would like to pick a twitter topic for London

As a User,
so I can pick what I content is being examined,
I would like to be able to choose the content that is analysed

As a User,
so I can see what people feel about my topic,
I would like to be able to see the analysis
```

## Getting started
Clone the repo with `git clone this_project_url`.

You will need some API keys, locally, in your Travis CI and/or Heroku settings:

* A [Django SECRET_KEY](https://github.com/kirillzabrodin/tweet_mood/blob/master/mysite/settings.py) - this is automatically generated on a new Django set-up, and can be a random string.  Keep yours hidden as it gives admin rights for the project.

* An API key for [Watson](https://github.com/kirillzabrodin/tweet_mood/blob/master/tweetmood/watson.py) - this can be gotten from [the bluemix website](https://console.bluemix.net/).

* You will also need a [Twitter key](https://github.com/kirillzabrodin/tweet_mood/blob/tweepy/tweetmood/tweeterpy.py) and any other required credentials for making requests to the twitter API. Those will go into your environment as the twitter documentation instructs you.

Make sure you have python 3 and pip 3 installed. If you have python 2 installed as well change python to python3 in the code below. Do the same for pip by changing it to pip3.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run `python ./manage.py runserver` or `python3 ./manage.py runserver`

This defaults to port 8000, so open `localhost:8000` in your browser.

Please note that the app will take a short while to deploy as Holmes (see below) will take approximately 10-15 seconds to train on deployment.

## Usage

At the moment whatever you type in will be analysed and the prominent mood displayed. Further progress will be shared shortly.

### Holmes and Watson

Holmes and Watson are two distinct sentiment analysers.

Holmes is a NaiveBayesClassifier, imported from [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html#) / [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) and subject to supervised machine learning in order to classify text as positive or negative.

By default, Holmes is trained on a sample of 2,000 tweets (1,000 positive, 1,000 negative).  These tweets were taken from the huge library available from Stanford University's [Sentiment140 project](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/).  The raw data from Sentiment140 can be formatted for use by Holmes by using the program in 'tweetmood/holmes_data/csv_formatting.py' - input the relevant file paths then run:
```
python tweetmood/holmes_data/csv_fomatting.py
```
or
```
python3 tweetmood/holmes_data/csv_fomatting.py
```

Holmes can be trained on different data sets.  This repository contains a larger formatted tweet sample set: replacing
```
with open('tweetmood/holmes_data/reformatted_small_train.csv', 'r') as train:
```
in 'tweetmood/holmes.py' with
```
with open('tweetmood/holmes_data/reformatted_train.csv', 'r') as train:
```
will train Holmes on a data set of 10,000 tweets - please note this additional training takes more time when deploying the app.

To test the accuracy of Holmes once training has been completed, Holmes can be tested against a sample test data set:
```
with open('tweetmood/holmes_data/formatted_test.csv', 'r') as test:
  classifier.accuracy(test))
```

Watson is a question answering system developed by IBM's DeepQA project.  Tweetmood uses the Tone Analyzer functions of Watson.

## Testing

The testing framework uses:
* pytest (including pytest-django and pytest-cov for coverage)
* selenium

As selenium is used, make sure you have Firefox installed.

Run `pytest`. Usually running `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`/`python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput` and `python -m textblob.download_corpora`/`python3 -m textblob.download_corpora` is required to pass the tests.

To see a test coverage table run `open htmlcov/index.html`

To see code quality run `radon cc tweetmood/*.py -a`.

To use the linter run `pylama`.

The app uses a third-party API. Where required the tests mock calls to the API.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on [Heroku](https://tweet-mood.herokuapp.com/). The first load might take a while, but it will boot up eventually. This can be used without any API keys necessary.
